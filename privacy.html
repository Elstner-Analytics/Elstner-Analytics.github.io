<h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
<p>Elstner Analytics GmbH (EA) respects the privacy of every individual whose personal information it handles. This privacy notice sets out how EA collects, stores and uses that personal information and outlines our approach to data and its protection.</p>
<p>https://elstner.dev/ is owned and operated by EA. EA will be a data controller in respect of personal data that is collected through this website or that you otherwise provide to us. A data controller is responsible for deciding the ways in which and purposes for which personal data about you is processed. We may process your personal data ourselves or through others acting as data processors on our behalf.</p>
<section id="what-information-may-we-process-about-you" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-information-may-we-process-about-you">What information may we process about you?</h2>
<section id="business-contacts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="business-contacts">Business contacts</h3>
<p>As a part of its day to day operations EA meets large numbers of business contacts at meetings and receives emails about business opportunities. It is likely to receive and store personal information on those it meets.</p>
<p>If you have had contact with EA, for example through emailing us or meeting a member of the team, it is likely that we will want to make a note of that email or meeting and may store limited amounts of personal information relating to you, such as your name, job title, employer organisation and contact details.</p>
<p>We will collect and store this personal information for the purposes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintaining a record of contacts;</li>
<li>providing periodic business updates;</li>
<li>drawing to your attention business opportunities which may be of mutual benefit to us as described below; and</li>
<li>organising meetings with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The personal information we hold about business contacts may be shared with: - professional advisors; and/or - companies who hold or ‘process’ personal information on our behalf, or cloud-based products.</p>
<p>The legal basis for collecting and storing such personal information about you is that such processing is necessary for our legitimate interests in running and promoting our business.</p>
</section>
<section id="suppliers-and-professional-advisors" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="suppliers-and-professional-advisors">Suppliers and professional advisors</h3>
<p>As a part of its day to day operations EA is likely to receive and store personal information to enable it to buy office and other supplies or engage with professional advisors.</p>
<p>If you are a supplier or professional advisor to EA, we will capture and use limited amounts of personal information relating to you, including your name, job title, qualifications, employer organisation and contact details. We will store this personal information for the purposes of administering and maintaining records of services or advice we have received and commissioning further services.</p>
<p>The personal information we hold about suppliers and professional advisors may be shared with:</p>
<ul>
<li>other professional advisors;</li>
<li>companies who hold or ‘process’ personal information on our behalf, or cloud-based products.</li>
</ul>
<p>We store and process information in this way because it is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
<li>perform a contract to which you are likely to be a party;</li>
<li>comply with a legal or regulatory obligation; and/or</li>
<li>protect our legitimate interests in running and promoting our business.</li>

In such circumstances we will explain this to you including the possible consequences of not providing particular information. In any event EA will only process the personal information you provide to TSMC for the purposes listed above.</p>

<section id="fees" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fees">Fees</h3>
<p>You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-we-may-need-from-you" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-we-may-need-from-you">What we may need from you</h3>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights).
